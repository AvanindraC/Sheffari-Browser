# Sheffari-Browser
Kinda clone of the Safari Browser, another addition to [MkOsh Project](https://github.com/Mengo-Team/MkOsh). I decided to make one Safari-type app for MkOsh. Just for fun! The MkOsh project goes more interesting in every step I proceed. It's kinda like a custom suite of applications.
